# Tensorflow Sandbox

This repo is a sandbox to learn the Tensorflow deep learning framework. The project uses the framework version `2.19.0` and the `Keras` high-level API. The [MNIST](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) dataset was used to train a neural network and to evaluate its performance.
